"YOU: Hi Isabelle, Alice told me you could tell me more about Timur's technical skills. ISABELLE: Yeah, sure! From what I know, most of Timur's programming experience is in Python, Javascript and C. He also knows some Java, C++ and Swift/Objective-C. He's pretty strong with database/model schema, knows his data structures and algorithms and has good front-end/javascript skills with frameworks like Backbone, Angular, React, D3, Underscore and Node. I'm sure there is a lot more to be said but you can check out some of his projects on github. There's a link to his profile on the bottom of this page. YOU: I will definitely take a look later! ISABELLE: You better! YOU: Thanks Isabelle, I appreciate your help. ISABELLE: You're welcome.",
