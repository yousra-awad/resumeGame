"YOU: Hi, Alice! I'm looking for a competent, friendly, team oriented developer. Do you have someone to recommend? ALICE: mmm... Yeah! Do you know Timur? He's currently a Tech Lead at American Express, leading a cross-functional team in a re-platforming initiative for all digital acquisitions. He's a full stack developer with experience on the front-end, back-end and even with microcontrollers. His main languages are Javascript and Python, but he considers himself mostly language agnostic. His current interests involve functional programming, modeling databases and thinking about relational vs non-relational tradeoffs, data modeling, creating useful abstractions, data structures, API design, UI develoment, MV* frameworks and mobile app development. YOU: Thank you Alice, that was informative. ALICE: No worries. You might want to talk to Isabelle for more details about his technical skills. She's the one working a few desks to my right. You can also download his resume in either word or pdf format on the bottom of this page. YOU: Thanks, take care now! ALICE: Bye bye!"}
